community_plan: "SlowMist has plans to contribute to the development of the IoTeX community by building and supporting various initiatives.     We have been tracking IoTeX market data since December 2018. As part of the SlowMist website, an IoTeX widget that displays IoTeX market data is made available to the community. Through the SlowMist API, users can also query historical IoTeX data or also download in CSV format. Awareness    We are able to contribute by helping to grow the IoTex community within the global community. As SlowMist covers a wide user, our reach can help IoTex grow its presence. An example of how we can create awareness would be via IOTX token giveaways to the SlowMist community. We would continue to explore other avenues of growing awareness as we familiarize ourselves with the IoTex network.     As we move forward and keep up with the development of IoTex, we are looking to explore opportunities to build other tools in the cryptocurrency space that would benefit the IoTex community. We would like to hear your suggestions and encourage the IoTeX community to email suggestions to us at keywolf@slowmist.com"
