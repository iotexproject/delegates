introduction: "We are a team of developers who have spent most of our careers in investment banking but in 2015 we saw the light and decided to join the blockchain movement and disrupt the financial services industry, effectively \"biting the hand that feeds us\". Our vision is to help remove the redundant financial intermediaries that are no longer required due to the disruptive nature of this technology and the problems this technology can solve.\n\nThe fees we all pay to financial institutions, which offer us secure and guaranteed transactions, are quickly becoming obsolete. Blockchain doesn't need expensive luxury offices, high salaries and obscene bonuses. These are not the ingredients to guarantee trust, whereas mathematics can and does provide trust for all borderless transactions."
