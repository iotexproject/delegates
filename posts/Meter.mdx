introduction: "Meter.io creates the first fully decentralized stable cryptocurrency backed by computation and competitive price of electricity, which historically is more stable than any fiat currencies in the world.  Our founder was one of the early supporters for IOTEX.  We believe the technical capability and the commitment of the IOTEX team to the crypto space.  We would like to work with the IOTEX in the long run.   To foster the bootstrap of the IOTEX mainnet, we would like to provide delegate service to the IOTEX community.  All the rewards (including block and epoch rewards) will be distributed to the stake holder on pro rata basis.  As the proof of value consensus of Meter.io is a hybrid proof of work and proof of stake system, we have expertise to operate the service at scale efficiently"
