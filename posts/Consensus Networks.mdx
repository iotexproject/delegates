blurb: "Shaping the future of blockchain by creating exceptional value and technology for our partners."
website: "https://consensusnetworks.com/iotex/"
introduction: "Consensus Networks designs, builds, and supports infrastructure for blockchain technology. Founded in 2016, we are 100% focused on providing top tier network and ledger operations support. In 2018 we were awarded a phase I SBIR for our HealthLink network, a blockchain powered system for health data transfer. We are moving into a capability demonstration stage this spring in partnership with several hospital systems. We provide network support as node operators across several testnets including Factom, Cosmos, Polkadot, Ethereum, and IoTex as well as support for enterprise Hyperledger Fabric use cases and Bitcoin’s Lightning network. Our company was founded by data center and cloud infrastructure experts and we have deep technical experience building hardware and cloud environments."
team: "Nate Miller - CEO:  Nate Miller is a 2011 graduate of the United States Naval Academy with a bachelor’s of science in systems engineering. He attended the U.S. Navy’s nuclear power and submarine officer training before being assigned to an Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine, the USS Maine. Miller earned a Masters of Science from the University of Notre Dame in 2018. He is a member and contributor to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) working group on Blockchain for Industrial Applications. He also is an adjunct professor at the University of Notre Dame where he teaches an introductory blockchain course.    \n\nDr. Shane Fimbel - Founder, VP Strategy:  Dr. Fimbel has significant expertise in developing and operating high-growth companies.  As the co-founder and Chief Executive Officer for Trek10, Dr. Fimbel developed the company into one of the leading Amazon Web Services Advanced Partners.  With global reputation in the field of serverless computing, Trek10 designs, builds, and supports cutting edge solutions for clients using the best in breed services from AWS.  Previously, Dr. Fimbel led the growth of data center, cloud infrastructure, and fiber optic networks in the Midwest closing debt, equity, and tax incentive transactions of over $35M and built operations achieving consistent annual revenue growth of 40-50%.  Dr. Fimbel holds a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Notre Dame, where he was a Reilly Fellow. \n\nConnor Smith - Innovation: Prior to conducting his capstone thesis for a Master’s of Science in Engineering, Science, and Technology Entrepreneurship at the University of Notre Dame, Connor Smith completed his undergraduate education at Wabash College.  While at Wabash, he double majored in computational mathematics and chemistry with a research focus in algorithm and hardware development for chemical applications. Additionally, Smith has served various business development roles at early stage ventures and worked as a technical market analyst for the IDEA Center at the University of Notre Dame de-risking a portfolio of faculty technologies across multiple disciplines. He hopes to leverage his diverse background to explore new avenues for Consensus Networks to develop as blockchain continues to transform a wide variety of industries. "
tech_setup: "Initially we’ll be running on AWS to allow for quick and inexpensive changes to our hardware configuration during the early days of the network. We believe that globally distributed hardware, owned by globally distributed companies is the future of blockchain so we are very intent on transferring to an owned custom hardware configuration in our data center within 6 months.   Hardware:  VPS Processor: 8 cores @ 3.4Ghz each Memory: 16GB RAM Storage: 4TB SSD gp2 (throughput optimized) Network: 500mb/s"
community_plan: "We plan to not only support the IoTeX network as it grows, but take an active role in shaping its growth. In other protocols we have assisted in developing APIs, SDKs, and applications for the community both individually and collaboratively with other members on the network. We plan to do the same with IoTeX and contribute these type of tools to the community to help advance the protocol. We plan to help the community develop applications, create proof-of-concepts, and support solutions to help advance the IoTeX protocol and make it more accessible to all.   Another part of our promise to the network is that we will allocate a portion of our rewards as a delegate node to give out monthly rewards for users staking on our platform that contribute significant efforts towards this goal. This can take the form of developing applications on our infrastructure for use by the larger IoTeX community, making tutorials for others to learn, or referring friends to stake and contribute to the IoTeX protocol. "
reward_plan: "Breakdown:\nPercentage of reward distributed to our stakers per epoch: 90% (including all bonuses!)\nReward frequency: Weekly, but we'll be experimenting with automating this and see if every epoch is possible.\nThe remaining funds will be put towards infrastructure improvements as well as 10% of the reward distribution allocated for a community grant pool to help support and advance IoTeX\n\n\n\n"
