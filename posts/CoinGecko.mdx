We monitor various crypto data such as price, trading volume, market capitalization, community growth, open-source code development, significant events, and on-chain metrics. Our aim is to provide a fundamental analysis of the crypto market and we hope to elevate crypto participantsâ€™ understanding of fundamental factors that drive the market.

We are located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and have a strong understanding of the South East Asian cryptocurrency market. Both TM Lee and Bobby Ong have dabbled in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies since 2013 and started CoinGecko in April 2014. Our team is divided in half with TM leading the engineering department and Bobby leading the market research department. Our engineering capabilities are proven with CoinGecko consistently being one of the top 10 crypto websites in traffic reach. Our market research team has consistently produced [quarterly crypto reports](http://reports.coingecko.com/all-reports) for the past 1.5 years and our reports are regularly translated into multiple languages and covered by major media outlets. Here is our latest [2018 full year crypto report](https://bit.ly/2018CoinGeckoReport) - an 83 page PDF with an overview of the entire 2018 crypto market.In late-2018, we began to explore and research on the area of masternodes, staking, and on-chain governance primarily to improve our market research capabilities in the space. Our first masternode experiment started off with Tomochain in December 2018 where we are currently the second most-voted Tomochain masternode. In addition to that, we have also recently announced out intention to be an IOST masternode and Steem witness."

community_plan: "CoinGecko has plans to contribute to the development of the IoTeX community by building and supporting various initiatives. \n\n**Data**\n\nWe have been tracking [IoTeX market data](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iotex) since May 2018. As part of the CoinGecko website, an [IoTeX widget](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iotex/widgets) that displays IoTeX market data is made available to the community. Through the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/api), users can also query historical IoTeX data or also download in [CSV format](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iotex/historical_data/usd).\n\n**Awareness**\n\nWe are able to contribute by helping to grow the IoTex community within the global community. As CoinGecko covers a wide user base from US, Japan, Russia, Germany, and more, our reach in these countries can help IoTex grow its presence. An example of how we can create awareness would be via IOTX token giveaways to the CoinGecko community. We would continue to explore other avenues of growing awareness as we familiarize ourselves with the IoTex network.\n\n**Reach**\n\nWith our core operations centered within South East Asia, we are able to assist with outreach to the community here. One example would be to connect the IoTex Foundation to the local area through meetup organizers across South East Asia. CoinGecko also regularly organizes meetups in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and we would like to extend our invitation to IoTeX Foundation to share their experiences here.\n\n**News**\n\nWe will be rolling out a News section on CoinGecko soon and with this tool, we will be able to track and monitor latest news covering IoTex.\n\nAs we move forward and keep up with the development of IoTex, we are looking to explore opportunities to build other tools in the cryptocurrency space that would benefit the IoTex community. We would like to hear your suggestions and encourage the IoTeX community to email suggestions to us at hello@coingecko.com"
