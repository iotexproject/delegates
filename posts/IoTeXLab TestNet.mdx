community_plan: "I’ve been IoTeX Brand Ambassador since July 2018, and I fully believe in the IoTeX vision.

From that moment on I've been one of the most active users in the IoTeX community: I've been constantly learning about the IoTeX technology, and helping all community members, educating and informing them about IoTeX advanced features every day.\n\nIoTeXLAB is my way to further support the IoTeX project and community with more explainer videos and tutorials, organizing meetups and, most importantly, presenting IoTeXkey technologies at industry events, to promote IoTeX awareness and adoption. IoTeXLAB is also a community on Telegram, where everyone, can get direct support and clear explanations about IoTeX features, and discuss ideas and future initiatives."
