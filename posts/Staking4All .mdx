blurb: "Validator for Proof of Stake blockchains. Delegate to us for a easy staking experience"
website: "https://www.staking4all.org/"
introduction: "We want to make staking on blockchain projects clear and transparent so everyone can stake and receive returns on their crypto holdings. Stake with us!\n"
team: "New generation blockchains make use of validators to secure the network. These validators will create, propose, or vote on blocks to be added to the blockchain. Validators need to run secure hardware that is online 24/7. Many investors do not have the time to run validators. This is where we make things simple for investors by running validators that investors can stake with and receive reliable returns "
tech_setup: "We plan to run stable nodes for the IoTeX network, the only way to achieve nodes having more than 99% up time is to have more than one node. One node will be in active mode while the second node will be in stand by mode ready to take over from main node if any failures are experienced\n\nBelow you can find our expected hardware configuration:\nMain Node\nLocation: Google Cloud\nSystem: 12 cores, 16 GB RAM\n\nStandby Node\nLocation: Google Cloud\nSystem: 8 cores, 16 GB RAM\n"
community_plan: "We really want to live by the motto of “by the community for the community”. We therefore will engage with the community and take all requests into consideration. \n"
reward_plan: "At this stage rewards are used to cover server costs"
