introduction: "<p>&lt;p&gt;Metanyx are a technical team of blockchain enthusiasts who have been been involved in IoTeX community since the project was released. We believe that next-generation blockchains like IoTeX will mould the IoT industry unleashing the possibilities of blockchain technology. Metanyx are committed to building the IoTeX ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n"
team: "<p>&lt;p&gt;Metanyx at its core is a network of passionate blockchain enthusiasts that collaborate and share their collective skills and knowledge to mature the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n"
tech_setup: "<p>&lt;p&gt;Metanyx will utilize a distributed Google Compute Engine Deployment. The Compute instance will utilize StackDriver to monitor realtime logs and generate alerts, additional endpoint monitoring and application healthcheck scripts to check health will be deployed to ensure instance availability on the IoTeX network. Standard monitoring of CPU/Memory/Storage will also be utilized for capacity management. A fully synchronized standby server will be available to automatically take over if the primary fails. Servers will be running Centos 7 minimal utilizing Docker Containers to run iotex-core. Prometheus and Grafana will be configured to monitor blockchain metrics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Server Specs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;High Availability Server deployment\nProcessor: 4 Core Intel Skylake (2.4+ GHz)\nMemory : 16 GB\nData: Scaled up as necessary\nNetwork: 10Gbit\nServers will be scaled upped further if additional capacity is required.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n"
community_plan: "<p>&lt;p&gt;Metanyx will be an active role within the IoTeX community supporting users and developers to unleash the power of IoTeX blockchain. Metanyx has years of experience running high availability platforms as well as developing complex distributed applications. Metanyx will use its expertise to grow the IoTeX ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n"
