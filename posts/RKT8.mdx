introduction: "What is RKT8? First of all, it is a close-knit team of crypto-enthusiasts, in charge of which is someone who was the first to tokenize media resources among the post-USSR countries - influencer and blogger Sergey Rad. RKT8 includes several channels on YouTube, VK and Telegram, all having leading positions in the crypto-related theme. In addition, the team is actively engaged in the development and testing of the robot-driven sources of income. Such as, the robot RKT8 which is the first of its kind, has introduced to the public the concept of mining in social networks.\n\nThe guys from RKT8 are not going to stop at the achieved heights, and if you look at their road map, there is still a lot of work to be done, including expansion to new markets in 2019, which is not an easy task. Solving unconventional and complex problems, as well as finding new opportunities, is the second nature for the RKT8 team.\n\nBuilding a cohesive, strong community, and the subsequent relationship with it - it's their thing! But in fact, there are much more advantages. Among them, the development of each member of the community as a thinking investor, as well as highly profitable robotic investment tools (in-house development)."
