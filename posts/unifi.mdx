blurb: "Unifi Protocol is a group of interoperable smart contracts linking multiple blockchains economies together into one large DeFi marketplace. "
website: "https://unifiprotocol.com/"
introduction: "Unifi’s Global Governance token (UNFI) provides community governance, exclusive access to protocol rewards, and can be staked to the protocol to earn staking rewards.  Native token staking to Unifi’s blockchain nodes offers the unique opportunity to participate in a blended ecosystem where PoS stakers, lenders, liquidity providers, and DeFi projects all benefit from shared goals and a shared tokenomics ecosystem.  Blockchain stakers have the option to claim their node rewards as UP, the blockchain-specific utility token of the Unifi Protocol.  UP is 100% backed by the base tokens collected by the Protocol, and has a redeem rate that rises over time.\n"
team: "Collaborate and share their collective skills and knowledge to mature the ecosystem.\n"

community_plan: "Unifi believes the power of DeFi is in the hands of the community.  Unifi’s multi-chain and multi-service DeFi ecosystem is governed by the community through the UNFI token.  Our community-first approach to staking mirrors our revolutionary fee structure on uTrade which also shares 100% of the trading fees with liquidity providers.\n<p>On select blockchains, uStake will allow stakers to claim their rewards as UP. UP is automatically minted by smart contract on multiple blockchains and backed by the base token fees and node rewards generated by the Unifi Protocol on each chain. UP is redeemable at any time for those tokens. A portion of the base tokens are used to increase the redeem value every time new UP is minted, so UP has a redeem value that can never go down. That’s why it’s called “UP!”</p>\n"
reward_plan: "100% of rewards are given back to users\n"
