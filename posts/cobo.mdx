Cobo will also help establish user communities for IoTeX enthusiasts and promote awareness of the IoTeX project through our owned channels. Cobo will also be prioritizing integrations and support for the IoTeX DApp ecosystem. We are also looking to set up a fund for IoTeX community management, project incubation, and development-related products within Cobo.   "
