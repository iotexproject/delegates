community_plan: "We feel strongly about contributing to the IoTeX ecosystem and being a focal point in\nrallying the Australasian IoTeX community\n\nTo effectively provide the block producer services required to support thousands of commercial\nscale DApps requires not only an agile enterprise scale infrastructure solution, but a mature\noperational structure to monitor, maintain and manage that infrastructure.\nProfessional integrity, transparency, commitment, cooperation and independence are all\ncharacteristics that the IoTeX community can expect from ZHCapital.\nWe believe our proven experience will inspire confidence in IoTeX stakeholders, DApp developers\nand IOT based blockchain businesses for the operation and governance of the blockchain, while\nsupporting our region as a global member of the IoTeX community.\nAlthough based in Australia we aim to serve the entire ecosystem\nUltimately ZH Capital can be considered as Good Actors and Excellent Custodians of the IoTeX-\nMainnet and other side-chains soon to be launched. We have the required technical expertise,\nprofessionalism and infrastructure; we sponsor and support the best initiatives; we are upstanding\nmembers of the global community, highly visible and easily contactable; and we aim to make\nIoTex.IO the business-friendly platform is was built to be.\nA vote for ZH Capital is a vote for a positive inclusive future on IoTeX-Mainnet and sister/sidechains.\n\nIn addition to core block producer services, we add value to the overall IoTeX ecosystem by investing\nin our region and with global initiatives.\nFor example:\n- Help to bootstrap a thriving local developer community through education, conferences and\nhackathons, while developing partnership with universities and business.\n- Actively participate in the Asia Pacific blockchain community, representing IoTeX, while\npromoting awareness and the opportunity with IoTeX to business, start-up and developer\ncommunities.\n- Support local enterprise, blockchain start-ups and DApp developers to understand the\nsuitability IoTeX for their projects, offering advice and support.\n- Invest in global BP Operations, Governance, Architecture initiatives.\n- Be accessible to the IoTeX community and blockchain media.\nIt must be stressed ZH Capital will always have core block producer and governance activities as it’s\npriority; any community service would simply be assessed by asking the question, “will this\ncommunity activity provide a clear and direct benefit to the entire IoTeX ecosystem?”"
