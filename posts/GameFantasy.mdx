introduction: "  Dear IoTeX Community, welcome to my IoTeX Delegate page. I’m Wang Qiang, 32 years old. Currently, I’m chief software engineer at 31°north latitude Studio Ingenuity Team in Giant Interactive Group Inc (上海巨人网络科技有限公司).      I started to learn blockchain technology in 2017, by studying different whitepapers and reading source code, and I was particularly amazed by cryptoeconomics, a new economic model that may change the world!      In early 2018, I met IoTeX, a blockchain-based platform that integrates robust cryptographic primitives with a scalable and secure infrastructure. I was deeply attracted by IoTeX’s professional approach, accuracy, and its strong academic footprint. I decided to devote myself to realizing IoTeX’s final goal: connecting the physic world, block by block. "
