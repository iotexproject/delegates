blurb: "Crypto-native solutions for large holders of digital assets. Let us do the heavy lifting. "
website: "https://airfoil.services"
introduction: "Airfoil Services is a company that was built by developers and venture capitalists to serve the needs of the modern venture capital crypto portfolio. Our services include security, staking and any other issue a client with large holdings may have.      Core to our business is removing trust from humans by using crypto-native systems and protocols. Where we cannot use an autonomous systems, we lean on our experience to build the most robust and transparent methods possible.      In an ideal world everyone would control their own crypto holdings, however when paired with the structure of traditional business, we must blend the inherent security of crypto-systems with the real needs of businesses today."
team: "Our team has a unique blend of experience in the crypto-economy from many angles. We've been involved personally for half a decade, and all of us work full time in the space.      Zach Hamilton - Zach is the Founder and CEO of Airfoil, he also works as a Venture Partner at Hinge Capital. His experience in the crypto space goes back to placing VC investments into Ripple in 2013. He has been actively working with teams in the industry since then.      Josh Stinson - Josh is the CTO at Airfoil, his experience stems from years of operational security consulting for institutional clients in the cryptocurrency space as well as general cybersecurity consulting for large firms.      Kenny Cheung - Kenny is the Token Evolution Analyst at Airfoil. He oversees all of the data collection and monitoring for tokens both liquid and locked. He also works as a senior cryptocurrency trader at a Canadian hedge fund."
tech_setup: "For security reasons we do not disclose our exact tech setup publicly (please schedule a phone call if you are interested to learn more however.) In running nodes (or any other software) our team over-provisions with a 50% buffer per machine, and then (normally) two layers of redundancy touching multiple geographical locations. A slowdown or service interruption in one data center will not cause any issue with our architecture. Generally, our team will use multiple front-facing cloud nodes, and then operate bare metal servers privately when security schemes call for it. All private keys are backed up in multiple geographical, and jurisdictional locations and are held with m of n key splitting recovery schemes to prevent single points of failure. It is very important to stress that Airfoil is a security company first, and a staking company second."
community_plan: "It is our goal to perform not only as a top-tier validating partner for the IoTeX network, but to also stay at the forefront of technology and innovation in the space. Our team is looking for ways to improve staking economics for all involved parties every day, and we plan to help the IoTeX network in every way we know how. Since we are involved in other staking networks, we will bring insights from them, and hopefully be able to help IoTeX learn from the mistakes made by other staking networks in the past.      With most of our clients being VCs, we are in a unique position to educate them on the happenings within the IoTeX universe from an on-chain perspective. Ultimately our decisions are up to our clients, but our clients have a vested interest in seeing the IoTeX network succeed. We do not work with traders, or any other short-term thinkers. We're in it for long term value and so are our clients."
